    "text": "3.1.1 Setting an environment up using a requirements.txt file\nIn HSMA, we will be using one environment per module.\nFor example, the environment used for module 2 (discrete event simulation) will be used for all three of those sessions, but will then be different to the environment used for module 3 (geographic modelling).\nWhy does this matter? When using the approach in this chapter to creating an environment, you will want to structure your folders in such a way that allows you to create and reuse that environment for the whole module, rather than creating the environment anew for each session (or trying to navigate to that environment from a different location, which can be somewhat clunky).\nIn practice, what this means is you will want a top-level folder called something like ‘HSMA’, with a subfolder per module, like this:\n\nWithin this subfolder you will need to download and unzip the module folders from the HSMA Github\n\nIn this folder, you will then want to put the requirements.txt file for the module.\nAn environment will contain a specific combination of packages; each module uses a specific set of packages together, and you will be provided with a type of file (a requirements.txt file) that allows you to install all of the required packages in one go.\nrequirements.txt is effectively the equivalent of conda’s environment.yml file.\nIt just lists the packages - and optionally, the versions of these packages - that need to be installed into the environment.\nThe contents of a requirements.txt file might look a bit like this:\nnumpy==1.25.2\npandas==2.0.3\nsimpy==4.0.2\nThis will just tell VSCode to install numpy v1.25.2, pandas v2.0.3, and simpy v4.0.2 from the internet.\nAny additional packages these packages themselves rely on behind the scenes will automatically be downloaded as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt’s important that your requirements.txt file goes directly inside your module folder - otherwise it may not be picked up in a later step, meaning your environment won’t contain these specified packages.\nThis means your module subfolder may look something like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll requirements.txt files can be downloaded from the HSMA Github.\nFollow this link\n\nClick into the relevant module folder and then the requirements.txt file.\nYou can then download this file by clicking ‘download raw file’.\n\nThen save this file to the relevant module’s folder on your computer.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1.1 Opening a module folder in VSCode\nYou will want to open up the entire module folder in VSCode for the next step.\nFrom within VSCode, choose File –&gt; Open Folder.\n\nNavigate to the folder where you have your HSMA exercises stored.\n\nClick on the relevant module subfolder, but don’t enter it (i.e. don’t double click!). It should just be highlighted, then click on the ‘Select Folder’ button in the bottom right.\n\nYour explorer window will then look something like this.\nYou may need to click on the explorer icon - which looks like two pieces of paper on top of each other and is the first icon in the list on the left of your screen - to make this panel appear.\n\n\n\n3.1.1.2 Creating the environment\nPress CTRL + SHIFT + P to bring up the command pallette.\nChoose Python: Create a Virtual Environment. If this does not appear in the initial list, you may need to start typing ‘virtual’ to filter the list of available commands until Python: Create a Virtual Environment shows up.\n\nNext, select Venv.\n\nChoose a version of Python - you may only have one available.\n\nIf you put the requirements.txt file in the location specified above, you will then get this option:\n\nClick the tickbox next to it to indicate you do want the packages mentioned in requirements.txt to be installed, then click ‘Ok’.\n\nFinally, wait for the environment to be created. This may take 1-15 minutes depending on the speed of your internet connection and how many packages are being installed.\n\nAt the end, you will see a prompt appear along these lines.\n\nIf you now create a new terminal, you should see that the prompt now begins with (.venv), indicating that the environment is selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThere are a few reasons why this might not appear.\nYou may need to open a new terminal.\n\nIf your default terminal is a powershell terminal, try opening a cmd terminal instead.\n\nOtherwise you may need to close and reopen vscode, making sure you reopen the same folder again if it does not load automatically.\n\n\nWhen you then try to run code in the interactive terminal, you can see in the top-right corner that the .venv we have created has been automatically selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe first time you try to run code in the interactive terminal or a Jupyter notebook, you will be asked to install the ipynotebook package. Click ‘install’ and wait until the install finished. You should only have to do this once for each new environment you create.",

    "text": "In Principles of Programming, we talked about variables. We said these are essentially boxes that store information of a certain type so the program can refer to it later.\nIn many programming languages, we need to create a variable by declaring it. This means specifying its type alongside its name.\nIn Python, things are much more laid back. Variables are dynamic, so we simply assign a value to a name to create the variable, and the type will be automatically set based on the Value we provide. We assign values in Python using the assignment operator =. It basically says “Let this have a value of this”.\nThis can cause confusion if you’re new to coding. = does not mean ‘equals’.\nWhat will be the variable type of each of these variables after assignment? \nBecause variables in Python are dynamic, their type will change if we give it a value of a different type :\n\n\n6.0.1 Dealing with spaces in names\nIn programming languages, a space indicates a separation between instructions, values etc. So if we want to name something (like a variable) with multiple words then we can’t use spaces. There are two principle conventions for how we deal with this :\n\nYou can use whichever you prefer (though ensure you’re consistent) but snake_case is generally preferred for (and recommended by the developers of) Python.\n\n\n6.0.2 Variable Types - Single Items\n\nLet’s remind ourselves of some of the main types of variable, and see what they look like in Python.\n\n6.0.2.1 Numbers\nIntegers (int) are whole numbers Floating point numbers (float) are numbers with up to 15 decimal places\n\n\n\n6.0.2.2 Text\nStrings (str) are sequences of characters denoted using “ or ‘ (Note - Python does not have a separate variable type for characters, they are just strings of length 1)\n\n\n\n6.0.2.3 Truth\nBooleans (bool) take one of two values to indicate whether they are True or False.\n\n\n\n\n6.0.3 Variables that store Multiple Items\n\n\n6.0.3.1 Lists\nLists (list) are sequences of items, where the order matters. Duplicates allowed.\n\n\n\n6.0.3.2 Sets\nSets (set) are unordered sequences of unique items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou won’t come across sets too often in Python - so don’t worry about them too much for now!\n\n\n\n\n6.0.3.3 Tuples\nTuples (tuple) are ordered sequences (like a list) but are immutable (once created, they cannot be changed)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou won’t come across tuples too often in Python - so don’t worry about them too much for now!\n\n\n\n\n6.0.3.4 Dictionaries\nDictionaries (dict) are unordered collections of key-value pairs",

Most of the code you write will include imports of packages.\nWe write import statements at the start of our code.

In other words, nothing outside the function can see or use that variable.\nIn the previous example, low, high, number_1, number_2 and number_3 are local variables. If we tried to reference them outside of the function, we’d get an error (though we can create new variables with the same names, but they are different variables to the ones in the function).\n\nA global variable is one which is defined outside of a function. These can be used and referenced anywhere - all of the Python code can see it. However, if we want to change them inside a function, we have to use something known as the global keyword.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis is not typically recommended though, and is considered bad practice (and can lead to problems, as you can likely imagine), so we won’t teach it here.",

And each one adds another dimension to our problem.\nSo we need a solution that allows us to work with multi-dimensional arrays easily and efficiently.

This means that you can only store the same type of data (e.g. floats, integers etc) across the array.\nThe dimensions of a NumPy array must also be the same length consistently across the array (but can differ across dimensions).\nFor example, we can have an array which represents 3 departments, with 4 groups in each, and 10 people in each group. But we can’t have more or fewer than 10 people in each group, or more or fewer than 4 groups in each department. For real world data, this means we will sometimes have 0 or missing data for some values, and we deal with that differently depending on what we’re trying to represent.\nTo hammer this home, the below is NOT valid (but NumPy will let you do it, it’s just it won’t work as you think - you’ll end up with a 1D array with two values which are references to two lists) :",

Observe…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOne fantastic feature of pandas is that we can point to either a local file (one stored on our machine) or a remote file (one stored somewhere else - like the web).\n\n\nIn the example below, we are accessing a file called input_data.csv.\nIf this file was stored in the same folder as our python file, we would just do\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"input_data.csv\")\n\nWe can then show the first 5 rows of the data with the .head() method.\n\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatient ID\nName\nFlu Vaccine\nAge\nCounty\n\n\n\n\n0\n65192\nBob\nYes\n42\nCornwall\n\n\n1\n84568\nNigel\nNo\n27\nDevon\n\n\n2\n93765\nFlorence\nYes\n84\nSomerset\n\n\n3\n97865\nMartha\nYes\n57\nSomerset\n\n\n4\n12451\nSimon\nNo\n35\nSomerset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, we could also use a web location.

    "text": "47.1.1 The constructor\nThis is the constructor. It is the method that is automatically called whenever we say we want a new instance of our class (instantiation). The purpose is to set up the object ready to use.\n\ndef __init__(self, attribute_1, attribute_2):\n    self.attribute_1 = attribute_1\n    self.attribute_2 = attribute_2\n\nHere, the constructor assigns values to a couple of attributes for any newly created instance based on the two values passed in to it (ignore self - I’ll come back to that in a moment).\nThe double underscore before and after init indicates this is a dunder method (“dunder”= “double underscore”). These are also known as “magic methods”. They’re called automatically when needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMe, myself, and Self\n\n\n\nself is an important concept in Object Oriented Coding in Python. Basically, self stores the instance of the class (ie the copy from the blueprint). It can be a bit weird to get your head around, particularly if you’re new to coding.\nWe declare self as the first input to any method definition in the class. It basically says “Run this class method on this instance” (eg on Dan’s ambulance). BUT, when we call the method, we don’t include self explicitly (Python does this for us, behind the scenes).\nWhenever we need to refer to something belonging to this instance, we say self. to say “Give me the x that belongs to you”. Eg give me the attribute value that you (Dan’s ambulance) is carrying. Or run the method that belongs to you.\nBasically, by using self we refer to the instance of the class (the individual object) rather than the Class itself (the blueprint).\nThis will make more sense as you see examples… Promise… :)\n\n\n\n\n47.1.2 Class methods\nThese are the methods (functions) that the class has. Every class needs at least a constructor, but we can add other things too.\nThese work exactly the same as any other functions, except we always pass in self as the first input in the method definition (even if there are no other inputs).\n\ndef method_1(self):\n    print (\"This is method 1!\")\n\ndef method_2(self):\n    print (\"This is method 2!\")",
