You should write the game above along with the following features that 4-year old Dan didn’t implement :\n\n- a score, which starts at 1000 and which reduces by 100 for every unsuccessful guess,\nand which is displayed if the user wins\n- the user’s guesses are stored in a list and printed once the game is over\n- the game asks if the player wants to play again after every game ends\n- after each game, the player’s score is checked against the current high-score (default is 0) and if the last score is higher than the recorded high score then this replaces the high score.\n\nYou could also add some bells and whistles of your choosing!\n\nOpen the exercise in Google Colab: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/gist/Bergam0t/81eec03542933c78e0fedc7ed5918e4a/hsma_6_session_1e_exercise_5.ipynb\">\n  <img src=\"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\" alt=\"Open In Colab\"/>\n</a>\n\n## Sample Answers\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n# Click here to view the answers\nOpenthe solution in Google Colab: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/gist/Bergam0t/744f9d266208d56ff1be1fcf06f35b1e/solution-smarter-than-4-year-old-dan.ipynb\">\n  <img src=\"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\" alt=\"Open In Colab\"/>\n</a>\n:::\n\n## Answer Video\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n# Click here to view a video explaining the solution\n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/bM1S1jkGKA0 >}}\n\n\n\nThe code for this video is slightly different to the example solution given above.\n\n::: {#bbab74fd .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport random\n\ncontinue_play = True\nhigh_score = 0\n\nwhile continue_play == True:\n\n    user_guesses_list = []\n    score = 1000\n    guessed_correctly = False\n\n    computer_chosen_number = random.randint(1,100)\n\n    print(\"Welcome to the guessing game!
