# An Introduction to Programming Concepts

If you are following along with this as part of the HSMA course, we'd strongly recommend that you watch the video below as it will help give you a grounding in the concepts underlying programming before you start working with code.

It's not an absolute necessity for continuing through the rest of this book - but you may still find it useful if you are brand new to programming and have not come across concepts like conditional logic (if/else if/else), loops and object-oriented programming.

Alternatively, if you get a bit stuck on one of the coding sections later on, you may wish to return to this video to have a bit more of an in-depth look at those concepts.
